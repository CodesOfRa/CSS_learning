Things I (just discovered) in CSS

- [```:focus-within```](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:focus-within)
- ```:first-letter``` - applies style to the 1st letter of a block  
- [```:nth-child()```](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:nth-child)
- ```transition``` - change property values smoothly (from one value to another), over a given duration
- ```object-fit``` -  scale-down - defines how an element responds to the height and width of its content box
- ``` backdrop-filter``` - (blur(5px) contrast(.8))adds filters (like changing the hue, contrast or blur) of the background of an element without changing the text or other elements inside.
