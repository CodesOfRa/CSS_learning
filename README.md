Things I (just discovered) in CSS

- [*:focus-within*](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:focus-within)
- *:first-letter* - applies style to the 1st letter of a block  
- [*:nth-child()*](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:nth-child)
- *transition* - change property values smoothly (from one value to another), over a given duration
